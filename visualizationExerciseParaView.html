    <h3 class="title">Goals</h3>
    The goal of this exercise is to experiment various existing algorithms for
    the interactive visualization of complex data-sets. To do so, we will use 
    one of the most widely used visualization system: 
    <a href="http://www.paraview.org" target="new">
    ParaView</a>.<br><br>

    This exercise will help you have a concrete intuition and understanding of 
    the techniques described throughout the class.<br>
    After completing this exercise as well as the 
    <a href="visualizationExerciseParaviewConversion.html" target="new">
    exercise related to data conversion</a>, you will be able to import into
    ParaView any data-set you generated in other classes or projects and to
    produce insightful interactive visualizations.<br>

    <br>
    <!--<b>Duration:</b> 2 hours<br>-->

    <h3 class="title">Software prerequisites</h3>
    &nbsp;&middot; A recent version of 
    <a href="http://www.paraview.org" target="new">ParaView</a> 
    should be installed
    (4.1 or higher).<br>

    <br>
    The remainder of this exercise instructions assumes that the employed 
    operating system is Linux. 
    However, this exercise can be achieved with any OS.
    For non-Linux users, an easy alternative consists in installing a Linux 
    system (such as 
    <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org" target="new">Kubuntu</a>) within a 
    virtual machine (such as 
    <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="new">VirtualBox</a>,

    <h3 class="title">Documentation</h3>
    &nbsp;&middot; ParaView tutorials and sample data sets can be found 
    <a href="http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial" target="new">
    HERE</a>.

    <h3 class="title">Getting started</h3>

    <h4 class="title">Data package</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot; Download the data package 
    <a href="stuff/teaching/tierny_visualizationExercise_paraView.zip"> 
    HERE</a> and extract it under your home
    directory.<br>

    <h4 class="title">ParaView basic usage</h4>
    ParaView is an open source multiple-plateform application for interactive
    scientific visualization. It can be seen as a user-interface front-end to
    the VTK library. Notable features of ParaView are its support for highly
    parallelized and distributed processing as well as its remote visualization
    capabilities.<br>

    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView1.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView1.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    As shown in the above screen-shot, the user interface is divided into
    several panels:<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; <i>Pipeline Browser</i> (top left): 
    This panel lists the different
    data-sets that have been loaded by the user as well as the filter effects
    that have been applied to them;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; <i>Pipeline Browser</i> (middle left): 
    This panel enables to interact with
    the visualization properties of the selected item in the pipeline
    browser;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; <i>Information</i> (bottom left): 
    This panel displays statistics and
    properties about the selected item in the pipeline browser;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; <i>Color Map Editor</i> (right): This panel enables to
    interact with color maps;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; <i>Central View</i> (middle): This is where the actual
    visualization happens! Note that several tabs can be opened, to alternate
    between several visualizations.<br>
    Along the interactions, other panels can optionally be displayed, for
    instance to visualize and interact with planar layouts such as charts or 
    histograms.<br><br>
    ParaView follows VTK's <i>pipeline</i> philosophy.<br>
    In this paradigm, a
    visualization is obtained by applying a sequence of geometry processing
    tasks on one or several data-sets. In VTK, geometry processing tasks are
    materialized by <i>Filters</i>. Each filter takes some data on its input 
    and delivers some data on its output. 
    In the above example:<br> 
    &nbsp;&middot; 1 data-set has been loaded (<i>disk_out_ref.ex2</i>);<br> 
    &nbsp;&middot; 1 filter (called <i>Stream Tracer</i>) has been applied on 
    the input, yielding a pipeline object named <i>StreamTracer1</i>;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; 2 filters have been applied on the pipeline object
    <i>StreamTracer1</i>, yielding two new pipeline objects: <i>Glyph1</i> and
    <i>Tube1</i>.<br>
    Pipeline objects can be visualized or hidden by clicking on the eye icon on
    the left of each object.<br><br>
    Given a pipeline object, a large selection of filters can be applied to it.
    In the following screen-shot, the list of default filters is displayed. Only
    those that can be applied to the selected pipeline object are not shaded and
    can consequently be executed.<br>
    Note that with the menu <i>Filters -> Search...</i> you can easily search
    for filters by typing a few letters contained in their name.

    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView2.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView2.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    To load a data-set in ParaView, use the following menu <i>File ->
    Open</i>.<br>

    To save your current pipeline, use the following menu 
    <i>File -> Save State</i>. For each question, it is recommended to save the
    pipeline once the question is completed.<br><br>

    Now, let's get the exercise started.

    <h3 class="title">Domain visualization</h3>
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot; Load the following volume data-set
    <i>data/vectorFields/3-triangulation/output.vtu</i>;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Initially, you should be visualizing the following thing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView3.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView3.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    This visualization shows the boundary of our volume.<br>

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    To only consider as a pipeline object the actual boundary of our volume, one
    can use the "Extract Surface" filter. Apply it to the input data-set.
    At this point, you should visualize the same result as in the previous
    question.<br>
    What shading model is employed?
    
    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    The shading of the surface could be automatically improved by ParaView.
    However, it seems that some information is missing in the pipeline to
    trigger a smooth shading. <br>
    What is this missing information?

    <h4>Question 4</h4>
    Find and apply the appropriate filter to compute the missing information of
    the previous question to trigger a smooth shading of the surface. 
    <br>
    If you
    answered correctly this question, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView4.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView4.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 5</h4>
    Disable the visualization of your active pipeline object and enable the
    visualization of the input data-set.
    In many scenarios, it may be interesting to visually inspect the structure
    of the mesh on which is defined our data.
    In the <i>Properties</i> panel, adjust the right option to visualize the
    mesh as a wire-frame on top of the surface.
    <br>
    If you
    answered correctly this question, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView5.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView5.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 6</h4>
    The visualization in the previous question only enables to display the mesh
    elements on the boundary of the volume. It is often useful to also inspect
    the interior of the volume. To achieve this, ParaView provides selection
    features, which enable users to interactively select regions of interest in
    the geometry. This selection tool can be extremely useful in variety of
    other visualization tasks.<br>
    To use the selection tool, click on the "Select Cells Through" button at
    the top of the visualization panel. 
    This tool can also be accessed by hitting the key
    "f".<br>
    After selecting some parts of the geometry, you should see your selection
    highlighted in colors as follows:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView6.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView6.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>Question 7</h4>
    Find and apply the appropriate filter to create a pipeline object that only
    contains the selected cells. Further apply the necessary filters to obtain a
    smooth shading of the resulting objects with a wire-frame representation on
    top of the resulting surface.
    <br>
    If you
    answered correctly this question, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView7.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView7.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <a name="question8"></a>
    <h4>Question 8</h4>
    Apply the appropriate filters to visualize the boundary surface of our
    input data-set in smooth shading and modify the appropriate properties to 
    display it in transparency with a distinct color. Also, extract its feature
    edges and represent them with tubular surfaces.
    <br>
    If you
    answered correctly this question, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView8.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView8.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Further notes</h4>
    ParaView provides a few domain re-meshing features that might be of interest
    to help further processing in terms of accuracy or robustness. For instance,
    if the input domain is not a triangulation, it can be transformed into a
    triangulation with the filter "Tetrahedralize".

    <h3 class="title">Scalar field visualization</h3>

    <h4>Question 9</h4>
    Load the data-set <i>data/scalarFields/2-grid/output.vti</i>. By default,
    ParaView triggers a color map visualization of the scalar field, as follows:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView9.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView9.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    Play with the color map editor to improve the contrast of the visualization,
    in particular in between the canyon and the rims, to produce the following
    effect:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView10.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView10.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 10</h4>
    ParaView allows you to review the actual values of the scalar field on a per
    vertex basis. To trigger the spreadsheet view, click on the "Split
    Horizontal" button (top of the visualization panel in the center) and click
    on "Spreadsheet View". 
    <br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView11.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView11.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    As discussed in the class, raw numbers are difficult to interpret, hence the
    need for visualization. However, in certain tasks, it can provide useful
    information. Use the manual selection tool to identify the values associated
    with the dark red regions of the visualization.

    <h4>Question 11</h4>
    Find an apply the appropriate filter to generate out of this data-set a
    surface embedded in 3D, such that for each point, one of its embedding 
    component is equal to its scalar field value.<br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView25.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView25.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>


    <h4>Question 12</h4>
    Load the data-set <i>data/scalarFields/3-triangulation/output.vtu</i> and
    play with the color map editor to change the color palette according to your
    preference. For instance:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView12.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView12.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    Color maps (which define a correspondence between scalar values and color)
    are particularly useful for 2D domains but fall short for 3D domains. This
    paradigm reaches one of the major bottlenecks of the visualization of 3D
    data: occlusion. In particular since, the screen onto which the data-set is
    projected is intrinsically 2D, some data is loss in the visualization during
    the projection process.<br>
    To investigate the evolution of the scalar field within the volume, 
    use the same techniques as in <a href="#question8">Question 8</a> to obtain
    the following visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView13.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView13.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 13</h4>
    As seen in the above screen-shot, the user selection tool enables the user
    to select cells of the input domain. Hence, the boundary of the selection
    appears unevenly cut. Find and apply a filter that precisely cut the
    geometry along clipping planes. Also, adjust the color map to yield a better
    contrast on the cuts of the volume to reproduce the following visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView14.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView14.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 14</h4>
    A limitation of the above visualization is that it conveys information about
    the scalar field only along the clipping planes. An alternative is to only
    show in the visualization 
    regions of the domains for which the vertices take some value in a
    user-prescribed range. This can be achieved in ParaView in two ways:<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; By specifying an interval;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; By specifying an isovalue (for isosurface extraction).<br>
    Find the two filters that achieve these effects and try to reproduce the
    following visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView15.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView15.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
   
    <h4>Question 15</h4>
    Try to display at the same time the isosurfaces of at least 4 distinct
    isovalues. Use transparency and other effects (at your discretion) to try to
    reproduce the following visualization (note that normals may have to be
    computed for a better transparency rendering):<br>
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView16.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView16.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    As can be seen on the above screen-shots, isosurface visualization still
    suffer from major occlusion issues if many isovalues are considered. To
    overcome this issue while still visualizing most of the isovalue range, one
    needs to consider volume rendering.

    <h4>Question 16</h4>
    Load the data-set <i>data/scalarFields/3-grid/output.vti</i>.<br>
    In the following questions, we will try to generate a volume rendering that
    displays
    several materials of a foot acquisition. In particular, we would like to:
    <br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Represent the skin of the foot in red, and with
    enough transparency such that the inside of the foot could be visualized as
    well;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Represent the boundary of bones in white, with a bit of 
    transparency;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Represent the inside of the cortical bone in brown, with a
    strong transparency.<br>
    By isosurface extraction, identify the isovalues corresponding to these
    materials and adjust the properties of the resulting isosurfaces to achieve
    the color and opacity described above.
    <br>
    If you
    answered correctly this question, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView18.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView18.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 17</h4>
    Delete the isosurfaces from you visualization pipeline and select the 
    input data-set
    in the <i>Pipeline Browser</i> panel. Adjust the right property in the 
    <i>Properties</i> panel to trigger volume rendering.<br> 
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView19.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView19.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    Adjusting a transfer function can be a very frustrating task for a novice
    user. A standard strategy consists of the following steps:<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;For each material, draw a step function in the transfer
    function (<i>Color Map Editor</i> panel, cf the above screen-shot
    example);<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Then adjust the width and the opacity of these steps 
    functions.
    Note that these parameters can be adjusted directly on the curve or in the
    array below for more precision;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Finally, smooth the steps functions by inserting more control
    points.<br>
    
    After this transfer function tuning, you should be visualizing something
    similar to this:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView17.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView17.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    Notice that the volume rendering is much smoother than the isosurface-based
    rendering. Why is that so?

    <h3 class="title">Vector field visualization</h3>

    <h4>Question 18</h4>
    Load the data-set <i>data/vectorFields/2-grid/output.vti</i>.<br>
    By default, ParaView triggers a color map visualization of the data based on
    the magnitude of the vector field, as follows:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView20.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView20.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    This data-set is a time-step of a time-varying computational fluid dynamics
    simulation, where a fluid is continuously injected from the left to the
    right in the presence of a fixed obstacle (left). Such a procedure is known
    to yield vortices in the flow, organizing themselves with a very regular
    pattern known as the Karman vortex street. <br>
    In general, vortices are of
    special interest in computational fluid dynamics. For instance, in
    mechanical engineering, the appearance of vortices can reduce the efficiency
    of fuel injection procedures. In this question, we will try to visualize and
    enumerate the vortices of this data-set.<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;What scalar quantity (derived from the input vector field)
    could be useful to analyze vortices?<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Find and apply the appropriate filter that computes several
    types of vector derivatives;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;The quantity we are interested in is given by the Z component
    of the resulting vector field called "Vorticity". 
    Note that this vector field is defined on a per cell basis.
    Display this component
    with a color map and increase its contrast to reveal and distinguish the
    clockwise vortices from the counter-clockwise ones. 
    <br>
    If you got it right, you
    should be visualizing something like this:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView21.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView21.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Use the "Calculator" filter to extract an actual scalar field
    from the Z component of the "Vorticity" vector field. 
    The "Calculator" filter is an extremely useful filter, that enables to apply
    arithmetic operations on top of one or several data-sets;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Based on the thresholds you used for the contrast enhancement
    of the color map, use the "Threshold" filter to extract the vortices and
    display them on top of the original magnitude scalar field:

    <br><br>
    Do vortices necessarily correspond to regions of the domain where the flow
    has a high magnitude?

    <h4>Question 19</h4>
    A popular technique for the visualization of vector fields consists in using
    "Glyphs", such as arrows, denoting the actual vector in specific points of 
    the domain. Apply the "Glyph" filter and try to reproduce the following
    visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView23.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView23.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 20</h4>
    Load the data-set <i>data/vectorFields/3-triangulation/output.vtu</i> and
    try to reproduce the following glyph based visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView24.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView24.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    As it can be seen in the above screen-shot, glyph-based visualizations of
    vector fields often fall short because of occlusion. It can even yield 
    misleading visual insights. In this example, this glyph-based visualization
    seems to indicate a general trend of the vector field to uniformly point 
    downwards.<br>

    <h4>Question 21</h4>
    Find and apply the appropriate filters to:<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Extract streamlines;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Enhance their rendering by using tubular surfaces.<br>
    <br>
    If you got it right, you
    should be visualizing something like this:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView26.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView26.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 22</h4>
    To better estimate the depth of the streamline, trigger the volume rendering
    of the magnitude of the vector field.
    <br>
    If you got it right, you
    should be visualizing something like this:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView27.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView27.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    In the above screen-shot, thanks to the volume rendering, background 
    streamlines can easily be distinguished from the foreground streamlines
    due to the blue "fog".

    <h4>Question 23</h4>
    In the above screen shot, the direction of the vector can be visually
    estimated thanks to the streamline and their depth can be estimated with the
    volume rendering. However, the orientation of the vector field is this
    region of space is an information that is lacking from this visualization.
    Find and apply the appropriate filters to provide visual insights about the
    orientation of the vector field in this region of space.
    <br>
    This could look as follows:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView28.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView28.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 24</h4>
    The magnitude of the vector field is also an information which is lacking
    from the previous visualization. Adjust the appropriate properties to
    provide visual insights about the magnitude of the vector field.
    <br>
    This could look as follows:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView29.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView29.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Question 25</h4>
    Load the data set <i>data/vectorFields/3-grid/output.vti</i>. Find and apply
    the appropriate filters to generate the following visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView30.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView30.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    Note that ribbons, in contrast to tubes, enable to better illustrate
    small-scale helicoidal trajectories (turbulent area in blue).

    <h4>Question 26</h4>
    Load the data-set <i>data/scalarFields/3-triangulation/output.vtu</i>.
    Extract an isosurface for the isovalue 63.5.
    <br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView35.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView35.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    Notice the little "tunnel" in the center of the above screen shot. As the
    isovalue increases, this tunnel will collapse. To what kind of critical
    point does it correspond?
    
    <h4>Question 27</h4>
    Find and apply the right filter to generate the gradient vector field of
    this data-set. Then seed streamlines exactly at the point where the tunnel
    collapses. Make sure that the considered neighborhood
    around the seed point is small enough (radius property). Use a distinct
    color for forward and backward streamlines. 
    <br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView34.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView34.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    This streamline layout is fairly specific to a special type of
    topological event in vector fields. What kind of event are we visualizing?
    What do the streamlines we extracted correspond to?

    <h4>Question 28</h4>
    Notice that in the above screen-shot, the red streamlines seem to stop
    suddenly. Why is that so? In what situations does a streamline stop?
    By extracting isosurfaces of the original data-set (and selecting the
    appropriate components with "Extract Cells by Region" filter), display these
    stopping areas.
    <br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView33.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView33.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    To what topological event do they correspond to?

    <h4>Question 29</h4>
    Try to identify the most prominent saddles of the data-set and mark them
    with a sphere colored according to their type. For each saddle, extract 
    its separatrices.
    <br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView32.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView32.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>


    <h4>Question 30</h4>
    Compute streamlines (forward and backward)
    at various seeds (with a sufficiently small neighborhood radius) 
    within the data-set and display them
    with one color per seed. 
    <br>
    If you got it right, here is what you should be visualizing:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView31.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView31.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    What does this visualization highlight?


    <h3 class="title">Tensor field visualization</h3>
    <h4>Question 31</h4>
    Load the data set <i>data/tensorFields/3-triangualtion/output.vtu</i>.<br>
    Apply a series of clipping, find and apply the appropriate filter to
    display glyphs representing the eigenvalues and directions of the tensor
    field and try to reproduce the following visualization:
    <br><br>
    <a href="img/visualizationExercise_paraView36.jpg" target="new">
    <img align="center" width="100%" 
      src="img/visualizationExercise_paraView36.jpg"></a>
    <br><br>
    Note that the option "Limit Scaling By Eigenvalues" should be checked and
    that "Max Scale Factor" should be set to an appropriate value.
