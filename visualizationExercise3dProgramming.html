    <h3 class="title">Goals</h3>
    The goal of this exercise is to experiment with C++ programming... in
    3D!<br>
    A secondary goal is to review  the notion of  <i>visualization
    pipeline</i>  and to get familiar with  the key concepts of the 
    <a href="http://www.vtk.org" target="new">
    Visualization ToolKit</a> library.<br>
    After having completed this exercise, you should know how to program your
    own, interactive 3D applications.

    <br>
    <!--<b>Duration:</b> 2 hours<br>-->

    <h3 class="title">Software prerequisites</h3>
    &nbsp;&middot; A recent version of 
    <a href="http://www.vtk.org" target="new">VTK</a> (runtime libraries
    <i>and</i> headers) should be installed
    (6.0 or higher);<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; A recent version of 
    <a href="http://www.cmake.org" target="new">CMake</a> should be installed

      target="new">HERE</a>.

    <h3 class="title">Getting started</h3>
    
    <h4 class="title">Setting up a CMake project</h4>
    In the following, we will create basic C++ and CMake files and import
them in the IDE KDevelop. To do so, we will copy the content of the files 
displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the 
    <a href="stuff/teaching/tierny_visualization_introductionC++.pdf">
    C++ introduction notes</a>.<br>
    To do so, please use your favorite text editor, or proceed as follows:<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Open the IDE program KDevelop;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Click on the "Filesystem" tab on the left banner;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Create a new directory for our exercise: right click in the
list, "Create New -> Folder...". Enter this directory (left click on it);<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Create a new *cpp file: "Create New -> Text File..." and name
it "main.cpp";
    &nbsp;&middot; Create a new file called "CMakeLists.txt";<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Left click the "CMakeLists.txt" entry you created. This file
should open in the center panel. Enter the content of Figure 2 in it;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Load this CMakeLists.txt file in your project: "Project ->
Open / Import Project...", explore the file-system to select it (and press the
subsequent "OK" and "Finish" buttons that will pop up);<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Enter the content of Figure 1 in your file "main.cpp";<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; Click on the "Build" button. At this point, you should be
seeing something like this:
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_intro1.jpg" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%"

      <br><br>
    If this is the case, congratulations! You just wrote, compiled and executed
your first C++ program!


    <h3 class="title">C++ Programming for Dummies</h3>
    Unless you already have some experience with C++ programming, it is highly
recommended that you consider the following questions before moving on to 
the
<a href="#vtk">
next section</a>. 
If you are familiar with programming in general but not with C++,
you might want to start with 
<a href="#cplusplus">
question 4</a>.

    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    In your file "main.cpp", enter the content of Figure 6 (C++ lecture notes).
    Build your program and execute it.<br>
    Modify the initial values of the variable "myIntegerVariable" and 
build/execute again to observe the outcome.

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    In your file "main.cpp", enter the content of Figure 7 (C++ lecture notes).
    Build your program and execute it.<br>
    Modify the initial values of the variables A and B and build/execute again
to observe the outcome.
   

    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;In your file "main.cpp", enter the content of Figure 10.
Build/execute your code;<br>
    &nbsp;&middot;Update your file to reproduce the code from Figure 11.
Build/execute your code;<br>
     &nbsp;&middot;Update your file to reproduce the code from Figure 12.
Build/execute your code.<br>
    Have you noticed any difference?
   
   
    <a name="cplusplus"></a> 
    <h4>Question 4</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot; Generate the files "Computer.h" and "Computer.cpp" to
reproduce the Figures 13, 14 and 15 
of the lecture notes. Note that you will need to
add the entry "Computer.cpp" right next to the "main.cpp" entry in your
"CMakeLists.txt" file. You will also need to insert the following line in the
beginning of this file:<br>
&nbsp;<i>include_directories(".")</i><br>
Build/execute your code. Modify the content of the
internal variables in the constructor then build/execute again and observe the
outcome.
    <h4>Question 5</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot; Generate the files "Laptop.h", "Laptop.cpp", "Desktop.h" and
"Desktop.cpp" to reproduce the Figures 16, 17 and 18 of the lecture notes. Note
that you will need to add the corresponding entries in your "CMakeLists.txt"
file.
Build/execute your code. Modify the content of the
internal variables in the constructor then build/execute again and observe the
outcome.

    <h4>Question 6</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot; Reproduce the code from the 
Figure 19 of the lecture notes, to 
get familiar with the STL <i>vector</i> container. Build/execute your code and
observe the outcome.

      <h3 class="title">A quick introduction to 3D programming with VTK</h3>
      In this section, we will develop a basic interactive 3D application with 
VTK. This application will:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; Generate a triangulation with two tetrahedra;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; Create a graphical window, attach it to a
renderer and an interactor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; Create a scene object for the triangulation and
attach it to the renderer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; Handle keyboard events to interact with the display
properties of the triangulation;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; Create a VTK pipeline to apply a sequence of basic
geometry processing tasks on our triangulation prior to its rendering.<br>

<br>
In the remainder of this exercise, for simplicity, we will 
enter all of our C++
code into the function <i>main()</i> of the file "main.cpp".

    <h4>Question 8</h4>
    Modify your file "CMakeLists.txt" to make sure that your program builds and
links with the VTK library. To do so, borrow inspiration from Figure 3 of the
lecture notes.

    <h4>Question 9</h4>
    To get started, we will have our program generate a basic 3D object (made of
2 tetrahedra) to
visualize. First, we will create a set of 3D points, which will be later used by
our triangulation. To do so, we will use the
VTK class called <i>vtkPoints</i>.<br><br>

      VTK uses its own memory allocation and management system. This means that
      VTK objects <i>cannot</i> 
      be declared directly. Instead, <i>pointers</i> to VTK
      objects must be declared as follows:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>vtkPoints *pointSet_ = NULL;</i><br>
      Later, the memory for this object needs to be <i>dynamically</i> allocated with the following
instruction:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>pointSet_ = vtkPoints::New();</i><br>
      The above lines declare a pointer to a 
      <i>vtkPoints</i> object (named <i>pointSet_</i>) 
      and allocate the necessary memory for it
(with the call to the function
      <i>New()</i>).<br><br>
      <b>&nbsp;&middot;Warning!</b> Dynamic memory allocation requires some attention. Each
      object which has been dynamically allocated must be de-allocated when it
      is no longer used in order to free the corresponding memory. With VTK, 
      for each dynamically allocated object,
      one typically needs to free its memory
      at the end of the function where it has been used (here at the end of
      <i>main()</i>) with the following
      instruction:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <i>(*pointSet_).Delete();</i><br><br>
      <b>&nbsp;&middot;Important Note:</b> In the remainder of this exercise, it is recommended
to <b>always</b> declare the pointers in the preamble of the file "main.cpp"
(after the <i>#include</i> instructions). The corresponding memory allocation
should happen within a valid function, such as <i>main()</i>.
<br><br>

      To refer to the specification of any VTK class that you use from your C++
program, you should include the corresponding header file in the preamble of
your source file, with the following pre-processor instruction:<br>
<i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#include &lt;vtkPoints.h&gt;</i><br><br>


    Declare and allocate a <i>vtkPoints</i> from your C++ code (and do not
forget to delete the corresponding memory after usage).

    <h4>Question 10</h4>
    We will now insert 3D points in this object. In particular, we will consider
the following points for instance:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; (0, 0, 1)  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; (0, 1, 0)  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; (1, 0, 0)  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; (0, 0, 0)  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot; (0, 0, -1)  <br>
    To add these points to the <i>vtkPoints</i> object, we will use its function
<i>InsertNextPoint()</i> for each of them. Please refer to the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkPoints" target="new">
documentation of
this class</a> to understand how to use this function. Note that this function
will return a unique integer identifier that can be used later, to refer to a
specific point among the set. Go ahead and insert these points in the point set.

  <h4>Question 11</h4>
  We will now create a list of point identifiers which describe a tetrahedron. 
This
list of point identifiers will be used to add this tetrahedron to our
triangulation.<br>  

Include the necessary header file, declare and allocate a
<i>vtkIdList</i> object (and do not forget to delete the corresponding memory at
the end of the program). 
This object is meant to store the identifiers of the
points we created for further usage. For the first 4 points of the previous
question, insert their corresponding identifier in the list with the function
<i>InsertNextId()</i> 
(see the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkIdList" target="new">
class documentation</a>).

  <h4>Question 12</h4>
  We will now create a data-structure to represent triangulations (sets of
simplicies, such as tetrahedra).<br>
  Include the necessary header file, declare and allocate a
<i>vtkUnstructuredGrid</i> object (and do not forget to delete the corresponding memory at
the end of the program). 
This object is meant to store a triangulation (described in the 
<a href="visualizationClass.html#domainRep" target="new">
domain representations</a> class).<br><br>
&nbsp;&middot;Link this object to the 3D point set with the function <i>SetPoints()</i> of the
<i>vtkUnstructuredGrid</i> class.<br>
&nbsp;&middot;Insert a cell of type <i>VTK_TETRA</i> in this data-structure with its function
<i>InsertNextCell()</i> 
(see the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkUnstructuredGrid" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br>
Build and execute your program. If you got it right, you just created a
triangulation made of one tetrahedron. Congrats!

  <h4>Question 13</h4>
  Create a second <i>vtkIdList</i> object which contains the identifiers of the
last point and the first 3 points of the point set.
Insert this
tetrahedron in the <i>vtkUnstructuredGrid</i> object.

  <h4>Question 14</h4>
  We will now create an empty graphical window, which will later contain a
rendering of our triangulation.<br>
  Include the necessary header file, declare and allocate a
<i>vtkRenderWindow</i> object (and do not forget to delete the corresponding memory at
the end of the program). 
This object is meant to represent a graphical window in which a renderer will
later be inserted. Before the deletion of the corresponding memory, call the
function <i>Render()</i> of this object. Build and execute your code. What do
you observe?

  <h4>Question 15</h4>
  We will now pull the rest of the VTK machinery to insert a representation of
our triangulation within the visualization. 
To do so, we will need to include the
necessary header files, declare and allocate the following objects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkRenderer</i> (to perform the actual rendering
tasks within the graphical window);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkDataSetMapper</i> (to convert our triangulation
into a set of graphics primitives that are "renderable");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkActor</i> (to represent and interact with our
triangulation in our visualization).<br><br>
  &nbsp;&middot; Link the triangulation to the <i>vtkDataSetMapper</i> object with its function
<i>SetInputData()</i> 
(see the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkDataSetMapper" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br>
  &nbsp;&middot; Link the mapper to the <i>vtkActor</i> object with its function
<i>SetMapper()</i>
(see the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkActor" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br>
  &nbsp;&middot; Link the actor to the <i>vtkRenderer</i> object with its 
function
<i>AddActor()</i>
(see the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkRenderer" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br>
  &nbsp;&middot; Link the renderer to the <i>vtkRenderWindow</i> object with its function
<i>AddRenderer()</i>
(see the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkRenderWindow" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br><br>
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?

  <h3 class="title">Making your 3D application interactive</h3>
  <h4>Question 16</h4>
  We will now pull the necessary VTK machinery to interact with our 3D
visualization.
Include the necessary header file, declare and allocate a
<i>vtkRenderWindowInteractor</i> object (and do not forget to delete the corresponding memory at
the end of the program). 
This object is meant to provide interaction features.<br>
&nbsp;&middot; Link the render window with the <i>vtkRenderWindowInteractor</i>
with its function 
<i>SetRenderWindow()</i>
(see the 
<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkRenderWindowInteractor" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br><br>
&nbsp;&middot; Right after the call to the <i>Render()</i> function, call the
function <i>Start()</i> on the interactor.<br> 
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?
<br>
If you got it right, you should be visualizing something like this:
<br><br>
<a href="img/visualizationExercise_intro3.jpg" target="new">
<img align="center" width="100%"  
src="img/visualizationExercise_intro3.jpg"></a>
<br><br>


  <h4>Question 17</h4>
  The default interactor type in VTK is not necessarily the most intuitive to
use. Here, we will pull the necessary machinery to use a different interactor
style.
Include the necessary header file, declare and allocate a
<i>vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera</i> object (and do not forget to delete the corresponding memory at
the end of the program). 
This object is meant to provide trackball-type interactions.<br>
&nbsp;&middot; Link this interactor style with the interactor with its function
<i>SetInteractorStyle()</i>
(<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkRenderWindowInteractor" 
target="new">class documentation</a>).<br><br>
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?

  <h4>Question 18</h4>
  In the following, we will try to interpret keyboard events to interact with
keystrokes on our visualization. By default, VTK interactors have their own
handling of keyboard events. 
In our case, we would like to re-define/extend them. <br>What
object oriented programming concept could we use to achieve this?

  <h4>Question 19</h4>
  Create a class <i>CustomInteractor</i> that inherits from
<i>vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera</i>. The only two (public) functions that 
need to be
re-declared are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>static CustomInteractor* New();</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>void OnKeyPress();</i><br>

In the preamble of your C++ file 
(right before the <i>main()</i> function),
insert the following line 
to automatically pull the memory management
machinery of VTK:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>vtkStandardNewMacro(CustomInteractor);</i><br><br>

Now implement the function <i>void CustomInteractor::OnKeyPress()</i>  as
follows:<br>
<i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void CustomInteractor::OnKeyPress(){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string key = Interactor->GetKeySym();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Here we will insert our event processing (TODO)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Now we will refresh the display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Assuming your vtkRenderWindow object is named 
renderWindow_:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renderWindow_->Render();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vtkInteractorStyle::OnKeyPress();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</i>
If the user hits a key, this function will be called and the string object
<i>key</i> will contain the actual value of the key that has been pressed.

  <h4>Question 20</h4>
  If the user pressed the key "t", set the surface of our triangulation
transparent. This can be done by calling the following function:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>GetProperty()->SetOpacity(0.5)</i><br>
on the actor.<br>
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?
<br>
If you got it right, you should be visualizing something like this:
<br><br>
<a href="img/visualizationExercise_intro4.jpg" target="new">
<img align="center" width="100%"  
src="img/visualizationExercise_intro4.jpg"></a>
<br><br>


  <h4>Question 21</h4>
  Declare a boolean variable (source file preamble) named "isTransparent_" that
is set to true if the object is transparent and to false otherwise.
  Use this boolean variable to roll back the transparency if the user presses
"t" several times (this can be achieved by setting the opacity to 1).<br>
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?

  <h4>Question 22</h4>
  Modify your code, such that only the edges of our triangulation are
displayed if the user hits the key "m" (for mesh). Such an effect can be
achieved by calling the following function:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>GetProperty()->SetRepresentationToWireframe()</i><br>
on the actor.<br>
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?
<br>
If you got it right, you should be visualizing something like this:
<br><br>
<a href="img/visualizationExercise_intro5.jpg" target="new">
<img align="center" width="100%"  
src="img/visualizationExercise_intro5.jpg"></a>
<br><br>
Have a look at the 
<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vtk+doc+nightly+vtkProperty" 
target="new">property class documentation</a> 
to see what function could be
used to revert that effect.<br>

  <h3 class="title">Setting up a visualization pipeline with VTK</h3>

  VTK implements a <i>visualization pipeline</i> philosophy. 
    In this paradigm, a
    visualization is obtained by applying a sequence of geometry processing
    tasks on one or several data-sets. In VTK, geometry processing tasks are
    materialized by <i>Filters</i>. Each filter can be seen as a black box, 
which takes some data on its input and delivers some data on its output.<br><br>

    To connect two filters together in a sequence, one needs to plug the output
port of the first filter to the input port of the second one. For instance, this
can be done as follows:<br>

    A set of filters sequentially linked together then forms a <i>visualization
pipeline</i>. The extremities of the pipeline should be handled
specifically:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;The first filter of the pipeline should obtain its input data from a
source (in our exercise from some input data with the function
<i>SetInputData()</i>);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;The last filter should deliver its data to a consumer (in our
example a mapper).<br><br>

    The VTK visualization pipeline uses an on-demand data-driven execution 
scheduling strategy. This means that all the filters can be plugged together 
without being executed. The entire pipeline will be executed (or updated with
partial computations) only when the
calling program will ask for its output. 

  <h4>Question 23</h4>
  In the following questions, we will deploy a simple VTK pipeline that 
extracts the salient
edges of our 3D object and represent them with cylinders in the visualization.
The filter in charge of this extraction in VTK is called <i>vtkFeatureEdges</i>
. This filter takes as an input a surface representation of the data along with
its normals. To obtain a surface representation out of our tetrahedral mesh, one
needs to use the filter <i>vtkGeometryFilter</i>. From there, to obtain the
surface with its normals, one needs to use the filter <i>vtkPolyDataNormals</i>.
<br><br>
    
Include the
necessary header files, declare and allocate the following objects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkGeometryFilter</i>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkPolyDataNormals</i>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkFeatureEdges</i>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<i>vtkTubeFilter</i>.<br>

Connect these filters together to form a visualization pipeline in the function
<i>main()</i>. To get a nicer visualization, you may want to adjust some
properties of the tube filters by calling the following functions on the tube
filter:
<br><i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SetRadius(0.025);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SetNumberOfSides(10);<br>
</i>

  <h4>Question 24</h4>
  To insert the result of this pipeline in our visualization, one needs to
declare a new actor as well as new mapper. Since the output of the
<i>vtkTubeFilter</i> is a surface, declare and allocate a 
<i>vtkPolyDataMapper</i>. Also, declare and allocate a new <i>vtkActor</i>.
Finally, in the function <i>main()</i>, link this new actor to the renderer 
(as done in a previous question).

  <h4>Question 25</h4>
  We will now trigger the execution of our visualization pipeline if the user
pressed the key "g" (as in "go!").<br>
  In the function <i>CustomInteractor::OnKeyPress()</i>, modify your code such
that, if the user pressed the "g" key, our <i>vtkPolyDataMapper</i> object gets
link to our tube actor (with the function <i>SetMapper()</i>).<br>

Build/execute your code. What do you observe?
<br>
If you got it right, you should be visualizing something like this:
<br><br>
<a href="img/visualizationExercise_intro6.jpg" target="new">
<img align="center" width="100%"  
src="img/visualizationExercise_intro6.jpg"></a>
<br><br>
At the beginning of the function <i>CustomInteractor::OnKeyPressed()</i>, insert
the following instruction (assuming your tube filter is named 
<i>tubeFilter_</i>):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> cout &lt;&lt; "Tubes have now " 
 &lt;&lt; tubeFilter_-&gt;GetOutput()-&gt;GetNumberOfPoints()
 &lt;&lt; " points. "  &lt;&lt;endl;
</i><br>
Copy-paste this same line of code at the end of the function
<i>CustomInteractor::OnKeyPressed()</i>, right after the call  to the
<i>Render()</i> function.<br>
Build/execute your code. What do you observe?
