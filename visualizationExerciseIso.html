    <h3 class="title">Goals</h3>
    The primary goal of this exercise is to re-visit from a practical 
    perspective the topics covered during the lecture dedicated to 
    <a href="visualizationClass.html#scalarFields" target="new">
    scalar fields</a>, in particular iso-surface extraction on tetrahedral
    meshes.<br>

    A secondary goal is to get familiar with the VTK library,
    especially with its core data-structures, its basic rendering features as
    well as its pipeline philosophy.<br>
   
    The last, more childish, goal is to teach you how to write your own
    isosurfacer implementation that even beats VTK in terms of running time!

    <br>
    <!--<b>Duration:</b> 2 hours<br>-->

    <h3 class="title">Software prerequisites</h3>
    &nbsp;&middot; A recent version of 
    <a href="http://www.vtk.org" target="new">VTK</a> (runtime libraries
    <i>and</i> headers) should be installed
    (6.0 or higher);<br>
    &nbsp;&middot; A recent version of 
    <a href="http://www.cmake.org" target="new">CMake</a> should be installed
    (2.8 or higher). <br>

    <br>
    The remainder of these exercise instructions assumes that the employed 
    IDE is
    <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org" target="new">KDevelop</a> 
    (version 4.4 or higher) under
    Linux. However, this exercise can be achieved with any IDE under any OS.
    For non-Linux users, an easy alternative consists in installing a Linux 
    system (such as 
    <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org" target="new">Kubuntu</a>) within a 
    virtual machine (such as 
    <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="new">VirtualBox</a>,

      If you followed the previous instructions, at this point, your screen 
      should look like the above screen-shot.
      <br>

      <h4 class="title">Code skeleton</h4>
      The code skeleton provided with the exercise package is composed of 3 main
      classes:<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; <i>Editor</i>: This class stores the actual data-structures
      and drives the computations;<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; <i>UserInterface</i>: This class is in charge of the
      rendering management and of the processing of the user interactions;<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; <i>IsoSurfacer</i>: This class is right now a place-holder
      for your custom isosurfacer implementation.<br>
      <br>
      At this point, the code skeleton provides the following features:<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; Loading of the input data-set (in our example
      <i>post.vtu</i>, which is a simulation of liquid oxygen diffusion);<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; Display of the boundary of the domain with a color map;<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; Basic interactions with the scene (translations, rotations,
      scaling);<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; The rendering of the iso-surfaces to extract (TODO).<br>

      <br>
      Now, let's get the exercise started.

    <h3 class="title">Iso-surface extraction with VTK</h3>
      First, we will review iso-surface extraction using VTK. To do this, we
      will use the VTK notion of <i>Filter</i>. <br>
      In VTK, a filter is a
      standardized processing unit that accepts data on its input 
      (<i>SetInput()</i>) and delivers data on its output (<i>GetOutput()</i>)
      after it has been triggered for execution (various parameters can also be
      defined to tune the filter).<br>
      In VTK, filters can be plugged to each other beforehand to form a 
      <i>Pipeline</i>. Hence, a visualization program can be quickly put
      together by simply connecting filters together and running the pipeline.
      More information is available 
      <a target="new" href="https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Cxx/GeometricObjects/CylinderExample/">
      HERE</a>.<br>
      To trigger the execution of a filter independently of a pipeline, its
      function <i>Update()</i> should be called.<br>

      <br>
      

      <h4>Question 1</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; 
      Once the skeleton program is running, hitting the key
      '<i>a</i>' will trigger the code for iso-surface extraction with VTK.
      In the <i>UserInterface</i> class, where is this event
      captured?

      <h4>Question 2</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; From this point (capture of the <i>'a'</i> key event),
      follow the function calls. Which is the function of the <i>Editor</i> 
      class that is in charge of iso-surface extraction with VTK?
      
      <h4>Question 3</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; Complete the function identified in the previous question
      to extract an iso-surface with VTK. Be careful and pay attention to what
      this function returns and how its returned value is employed by the rest
      of the code skeleton (don't hesitate to browse 
      <a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/annotated.html" 
      target="new">the VTK documentation</a>).<br>

      If you correctly answered to the previous questions, you should now see 
      the following result by pressing the key 'a'.<br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces2.jpg" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces2.jpg"></a>
      <br><br>

      At this point, with no further change to the code, most of the keystrokes
      implemented in the code skeleton should be supported.
      
      <h4>Question 4</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; Go back to the function of the <i>UserInterface</i> class
      capturing the key events (question 1). For each keystroke, follow the
      corresponding function calls in order to understand the purpose of each
      keystroke.<br>
      
      &nbsp;&middot; Then, try to reproduce the following visualization:
     
      <br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces3.jpg" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces3.jpg"></a>
      <br><br>


      <h4>Question 5</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Extract an isosurface for the isovalue 57.5 (on the same data-set as
      before, <i>post.vtu</i>). Then move it up to isovalue
      58. The isosurface changed its topology. What kind of topological change
      is it? <br>
      How many of these events occur when spanning the entire function range?

      <h4>Question 6</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Same question as above for an isosurface extracted at the isovalues 63.5
      and 64.

      <h4>Question 7</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Regarding questions 5 and 6, what kind of critical point do 
      these topological changes in the level sets 
      correspond to?

    <h3 class="title">Implementing your own isosurfacer</h3>

      In the rest of the exercise, we'll move on to the implementation of your
      own custom isosurfacer. To proceed, we'll implement a VTK filter. You will
      find an initial skeleton for this filter in the <i>IsoSurfacer</i> class.
      <br>

      When running the program, to switch back and forth between the VTK
      implementation and your custom implementation, hit the key <i>v</i>. 
      The rest of the keystrokes work as before.
      <br>
      For the following questions, make sure you always execute your program
      such that the custom implementation is selected (by hitting <i>v</i>
      once).

      <h4>Question 8</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      In the <i>Editor</i> class, borrow inspiration from the function
      <i>extractIsoSurfaceVTK()</i> to complete the function
      <i>extractIsoSurface()</i>, 
      which should be using your own VTK filter class,
      called <i>IsoSurfacer</i>.<br>
      If you get it right, without changing anything to the provided code 
      skeleton for the <i>IsoSurfacer</i> class, you should have the following
      message on the console output:

      <br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces4.jpg" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces4.jpg"></a>
      <br><br>
      In the remainder of the exercise, we will implement an isosurface
extraction algorithm in the
class <i>IsoSurfacer</i>.

      <br><br><br>
      <h4 class="title">The naive way</h4>
      The naive algorithm for isosurface extraction consists in:<br>
      &nbsp;&middot; looping over the entire list of tetrahedra of the input 
      tet-mesh, and for each tetrahedron:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;
      computing, if it exists, the polygon which 
      intersects the tetrahedron along the level set;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;
      adding the vertices and the faces of that polygon to
      the output isosurface.<br><br>
      Have a look at <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i> to see how to access the input 
      tet-mesh, the input scalar field
      and the output surface from within the IsoSurfacer class. The
      corresponding variables are already initialized for you in the code
      skeleton.<br><br>

      To implement this algorithm, we will proceed as follows:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;We will implement a function
<i>IsCellOnLevelSet()</i> that will check if a cell (or simplex) is intersected
by the queried level set;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;We will implement a function
<i>ComputeEdgeIntersection()</i> that will compute for a given edge its
intersection point with the queried level set;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;We will implement a function
<i>ComputerSimpleIntersection()</i>, that
will
apply for a given tetrahedron the above two functions to generate the polygon which intersects the
input tetrahedron along the queried level-set;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;We will implement a function
<i>SimpleExtraction()</i>, that loops over the tetrahedra of the input mesh and
apply the above function.<br>


      <h4>Question 9</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      In <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i>, complete the function
      <i>IsCellOnLevelSet()</i>. This function returns true if the cell is
      traversed by the level set and false otherwise. <br>
      Warning, this function
      takes as input the abstract notion of <i>vtkCell</i>, which is
      dimension independent. In other words, this function should work if either
      an edge or a tetrahedron is given as argument.<br>
      Don't hesitate to have a look at the 
      <a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/annotated.html" 
      target="new">VTK documentation</a> to understand how to retrieve the
      vertex Ids of a cell and to retrieve the corresponding scalar values from
      the scalar field given the vertex Ids.

      <h4>Question 10</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      In <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i>, complete the function
      <i>ComputeEdgeIntersection()</i>. Given an input edge expressed as a pair
      of vertex Ids, this function returns the point where the level set
      intersects the edge.

      <h4>Question 11</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Complete the function <i>IsoSurfacer::ComputeSimpleIntersection()</i>.
      Given a tetrahedron given as argument, this function computes the polygon
      which intersects the tetrahedron along the level set and add it to the
      output isosurface.<br><br>
      In particular, this function should loop over all the edges of the
      tetrahedron. If the current edge is intersected by the level set
      (<i>IsCellOnLevelSet()</i>), its intersection point with the level set
      should be computed (<i>ComputeEdgeIntersection()</i>).<br><br>
      Once an intersection point is computed, to create the corresponding 
      vertex in the output isosurface, use the following call (see the 
      <a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/annotated.html" 
      target="new">VTK documentation</a> for further details):
      <i>Output->GetPoints()->InsertNextPoint()</i>.<br>
      This function will return the vertex Id of the newly created vertex.
      Finally, to create the intersection polygon, use the following code:
      <i>Output->InsertNextCell(VTK_POLYGON, pointIds)</i> where
      <i>pointIds</i> is a <i>vtkIdList</i> that you'll have to create to store
      the vertex Ids of the new vertices you will have created.
      <br><br>

      As a reminder, the possible intersections of a tetrahedron by a level set
      are summarized in the following figure:

      <br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces5.png" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces5.png"></a>
      <br><br>


      <h4>Question 12</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Complete the function <i>IsoSurfacer::SimpleExtraction()</i>,
      which loops over the set of tetrahedra of the input mesh. If a tetrahedron
      is intersected by the level set (<i>IsCellOnLevelSet()</i>), then the
      actual intersection polygon should be computed
      (<i>ComputeSimpleIntersection()</i>).

      <h4>Question 13</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      If you got the answers right up to this point, 
      here's what you should be visualizing if you
      extract an isosurface with your own implementation:

      <br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces6.jpg" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces6.jpg"></a>
      <br><br>
      This doesn't look great, right?<br>
      What do you think went wrong?

      <h4>Question 14</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      To answer and correct the above question, complete the function 
      <i>IsoSurfacer::ReOrderTetEdges()</i>, which given the list of the edges
      of a tetrahedron which are crossed by the level set, re-order this list
      such that the list describes a consistent winding around the
      tetrahedron.<br>
      Next, use this function appropriately from within the function 
      <i>IsoSurfacer::ComputeSimpleIntersection()</i>.<br><br>
      If you got the answer right to this question, your isosurface should no
      longer exhibit the cracks shown in the previous illustration.

      <h4>Question 15</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      For this question, make sure you're compiling your code in <i>Release</i>
      mode instead of <i>Debug</i> (in <i>CMakeLists.txt</i>).<br>
      Now compare the timings, for a unique isovalue,  between your custom 
      implementation and the VTK implementation (by hitting <i>v</i> to switch
      between the two).<br>
      Why is your code so slow?!!
      
      <br><br><br>
      <h4 class="title">The appropriate way</h4>

      A drawback of the naive approach you've just implemented is that the
      isosurface is computed as a collection as individual polygons, which are
      not connected to each other. Hence, the isosurfaces you computed were not
      <i>manifold</i> surfaces.<br><br>

      A simple fix to the previous algorithm would consist in visiting each
      vertex you created in the isosurface and merge it with any other vertex
      which is sufficiently close. <br>
      This is a terrible fix, with a quadratic runtime complexity if no spatial
      indexing structure is used.<br>

      The appropriate fix would be to store the vertex Id of each created vertex
      on the edge of the input tet-mesh where it has been created. 
      <br>
      In that way,
      when computing the intersection polygon of a tetrahedron with the level
      set, instead of re-computing all the intersection points (and vertices),
      those already created by already visited neighbor tetrahedra could be
      re-used directly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In the following example, the intersection of the first
      tetrahedron by the level set will yield the creation of the vertices 
      <i>v1</i>, <i>v2</i> and <i>v3</i> (and of the polygon <i>v1-v2-v3</i>),
      while the intersection of the second, neighbor, tetrahedron, will only
      yield the creation of the vertex <i>v4</i> and the vertices <i>v2</i> and
      <i>v3</i> will be re-used to create the corresponding intersection polygon
      (<i>v3-v2-v4</i>).

      Unfortunately, the VTK data-structure <i>vtkUnstructuredGrid</i> does not
      explicitly encode the edges with Ids, like it is done for vertices. A
      slightly more memory-expensive workaround consists in storing the Ids of
      the created vertices within each tetrahedron (in the above example, 
      we will store for the first tetrahedron the vertices <i>v1</i>, 
      <i>v2</i> and <i>v3</i>).

      <h4>Question 16</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      In <i>Editor::extractIsoSurface()</i>, call the following function
      <i>IsoSurfacer::SetType()</i> with the variable <i>Editor::type_</i> as
      argument, before the execution of the filter.<br>
      This will enable you to switch between your naive isosurfacer
      implementation and your new one at run time. Once the program is running,
      hit
      <i>s</i> to select the (simple) naive implementation, <i>Shift+s</i> to 
      select
      the (standard) appropriate implementation, and <i>x</i> to select the fast
      implementation (todo).

      
      <h4>Question 17</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Given a tetrahedron, the query of its neighbor tetrahedra is quite
      inefficient with VTK. Therefore, we will pre-compute these queries for
      each tetrahedron once for all, as a pre-processing stage, during the 
      loading of the input tet-mesh.<br>
      At the end of the function <i>Editor::loadInputMesh()</i>, add the
      necessary code to fill the vector <i>tetNeighbors_</i> 
      (see <i>Editor.h</i>). This vector should have as many entries as the
      number of tetrahedra in the input tet-mesh. The i-th entry of this vector,
      corresponding to the tetrahedron with Id i, will be a vector composed of
      the Ids of its neighbor tetrahedra.<br>
      To retrieve the list of neighbor cells of a given cell, use the function
      <i>vtkUnstructuredGrid::GetCellNeighbors()</i> (see
      <a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/annotated.html" 
      target="new">the VTK documentation</a> for further details).<br>


      <h4>Question 18</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Modify <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i> such that a pointer to
      <i>Editor::tetNeighbors_</i> can be passed to the <i>IsoSurfacer</i> 
      filter in the same manner the queried isovalue was passed to the filter.

      <h4>Question 19</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Modify the function <i>Editor::extractIsoSurface()</i> to pass the
      vector of tethedra neighborhoods to the <i>IsoSurfacer</i> filter, prior
      to its execution.

      <h4>Question 20</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      In <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i>, complete the <i>EdgeIntersection</i> class, which
      models the intersection of an edge of the input tet-mesh by the level set.
      This class should contain the Ids of the vertices of the corresponding
      edge, as well as the Id of the created vertex in the output isosurface.

      <h4>Question 21</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Borrow inspiration from the function
      <i>IsoSurfacer::ComputeSimpleIntersection()</i> to complete the function 
      <i>IsoSurfacer::ComputePartialIntersection()</i>. 
      Similarly to our previous implementation, this new function computes the
      intersection polygon of a tetrahedron with a level-set. <br>
      However, this new
      implementation should store within the current tetrahedron the vertex Id 
      of every vertex of the intersection polygon
      and further re-use
      this information when visiting neighbor tetrahedron.<br><br>
      Once the program is running, to select this new implementation instead of
      the naive one, hit <i>Shift+s</i>.

      <h4>Question 22</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Borrow inspiration from the function 
      <i>IsoSurfacer::SimpleExtraction()</i> to complete the function
      <i>IsoSurfacer::StandardExtraction()</i>. This function should use your
      new implementation (<i>IsoSurfacer::ComputePartialIntersection()</i>) 
      instead of the naive one.<br>
      If you got the answers right up to this point, you should have the
      following vertex count for the isosurface at isovalue 50 (it should be
      much smaller in comparison to the naive implementation):

        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces8.jpg"></a>
      <br><br>

      <h4>Question 23</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; 
      As shown in the above screen-shot, the new implementation might be a
      little faster than the naive one. Why is that so?


      <h4 class="title">The fast way</h4>
      We will now finally move on to a fast implementation of isosurface
      extraction. In particular, in this implementation, we would like to avoid
      looping over the entire set of tetrahedra of the input tet-mesh to compute
      the isosurface, but only those that are good candidates for an
      intersection with the level set.<br>

      The nice way to do it would be to implement a self-balanced 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree" target="new">
      interval tree</a> and to store in this tree, in a pre-processing stage,
      each tetrahedron according to its function span (to its function 
      interval).<br><br>

      A simpler implementation with comparable running times can be obtained
      with an interval table. The construction of this data-structure needs to
      happen in a pre-processing stage, at the end of 
      <i>Editor::loadInputMesh()</i>. The construction process is summarized
      with the following figure:<br>


      <br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces9.png" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces9.png"></a>
      <br><br>

      The interval table is a vector of vectors of tetrahedron Ids. The size of
      the table (represented by the width of the green array) is a parameter of
      the table, that needs to be set in the construction of the table.<br>
      To fill the table, all the tetrahedra of the input tet-mesh need to be
      visited. For each tetrahedron, its function range should be identified
      (tmin and tmax in the illustration). According to this function span, the
      Id of the tetrahedron should be pushed in all the intervals in the
      tetrahedra's function span.<br><br>

      In the above example, the interval table has a size of 6, which means that
      the entire function range (from Fmin to Fmax) is split in 6 intervals. If
      the global minimum and the global maximum of the scalar field have value 0
      and 60 respectively, these intervals, from left to right, will correspond
      to the function spans [0, 10[, [10, 20[, [20, 30[, [30, 40[, [40, 50[,
      [50, 60].<br>

      Then, when adding a new tetrahedron (here with Id 18), according to its
      minimum and maximum values, its Id will pushed in the appropriate vectors
      (3 in the middle in this example).<br><br>

      At run time, when computing an isosurface, given the isovalue, the
      interval table will identify which interval should be considered, and
      only the tetrahedron in this interval should be visited for isosurface
      extraction. This will drastically reduce the number of visited tetrahedra
      per isosurface extraction, hence yield a faster extraction.

      <h4>Question 24</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; 
      A placer holder for your interval table is located in
      <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i> (the class <i>TetIndex</i>). Declare the appropriate
      variables as protected member.

      <h4>Question 25</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Implement the function <i>TetIndex::setBounds()</i>, which will be called
      in a pre-processing stage and which will store the global function range
      (global and minimum and maximum) passed as argument.

      <h4>Question 26</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Implement the function <i>TetIndex::setResolution()</i>, which will be
      called in a pre-processing stage and which sets the size of the table
      (passed as argument).

      <h4>Question 27</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; 
      Implement the following function <i>TetIndex::addTet()</i> which will be
      called in a pre-processing stage and which, given
      the function span and the Id of a tetrahedron (passed as arguments), 
      stores the tet Id in the table.

      <h4>Question 28</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; 
      Implement the following function <i>TetIndex::getCandidates()</i> which
      given an isovalue, returns a pointer to the corresponding interval 
      (returns a pointer of a vector of tetrahedron Ids).

      <h4>Question 29</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      At the end of <i>Editor::loadInputMesh()</i>, add the necessary code to
      use the functions you implemented in the previous questions, in order to
      fill the interval table (using the variable <i>Editor::tetIndex_</i>).
      <br>
      A reasonable value for the resolution of the interval table is 500.


      <h4>Question 30</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot;
      Modify <i>IsoSurfacer.h</i> such that a pointer to
      <i>Editor::tetIndex_</i> can be passed to the <i>IsoSurfacer</i> filter in
      the same manner the queried isovalue was passed to the filter.

      <h4>Question 31</h4>
      &nbsp;&middot; 
      Borrow inspiration from the function 
      <i>IsoSurfacer::StandardExtraction()</i> to complete the function 
      <i>IsoSurfacer::FastExtraction()</i>. This function should make use of the
      interval table to only traverse a limited number of tetrahedra.
      Complete the function <i>IsoSurfacer::FastExtraction()</i>.<br><br>
      If you got the answers right up to this point, you should observe a
      reduction in running time, in comparison to the VTK implementation, 
      similar to the one shown in the following figure:

      <br><br>
      <a href="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces10.jpg" target="new">
      <img align="center" width="100%" 
        src="img/visualizationExercise_IsoSurfaces10.jpg"></a>
      <br><br>

      If this is the case, congratulations! You've just beaten VTK!

    <h3 class="title">Extra questions</h3>
    For those who found this exercise a little boring, here's a few more bonus
    questions that will help you implement the fastest algorithm for isosurface
    extraction.

    <h4 class="title">Yes we can!</h4>
    We can go even faster, in particular by making the extraction algorithm only
    visit the exact set of tetrahedra which are crossed by the level set.

    <h4>Extra question 1</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;
    Implement a function <i>IsoSurfacer::ExtractContour()</i>.
    This function takes as argument the Id of a tetrahedron that is known to be
    crossed by the queried isovalue (<i>IsoSurfacer::Value</i>). The function
    then extracts
    the connected component of level-set (called <i>contour</i>) which passes 
    through this tetrahedron.<br>
    In particular, this function should handle a queue (<i>std::queue</i>) of 
    tetrahedron Ids
    (containing initially only the input tetrahedron). Each time the
    intersection of a tetrahedron by the level set is computed (with 
    <i>ComputePartialIntersection()</i>), the current tetrahedron should be
    popped out of the queue and its neighbors whose function span is intersected
    by the isovalue (and which haven't been visited before) should be added to 
    the queue. This process should be iterated until the queue is empty.

    <h4>Extra question 2</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;
    We recall that in a PL scalar field, a minimum (respectively a maximum) is a
    vertex such that all its neighbors have a higher (respectively lower) 
    function value. A regular vertex is a vertex such that 
    the group of its
    direct neighbors with lower function value forms a single connected
    component
    AND that 
    the group of its
    direct neighbors with higher function value forms a single connected
    component too. Any other configuration is called a <i>saddle</i>.<br>
    Implement a function in the <i>Editor</i> class that identifies all the
    saddles of the field.

    <h4>Extra question 3</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;
    Implement a function <i>Editor::partitionMesh()</i>
    which segments the mesh along EACH contour of EACH saddle. Each resulting 
    partition should be stored as a <i>std::set</i> of pairs (vertex Ids -
    vertex function value). An
    <i>std::set</i>  is a readily available implementation of self-balanced
    binary search trees. Make sure to configure this class properly, such that
    the vertices get ordered by function value.
    <br>
    To create a partition,
    grow a region starting from a regular vertex and add each of its neighbors 
    to the
    partition if the
    corresponding edge crosses no saddle contour. Re-iterate the process until
    the current region cannot be grown anymore. 
    Re-iterate the entire process until all
    the regular vertices of the mesh are associated with a partition.

    <h4>Extra question 4</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;
    Borrow inspiration from the <i>TetIndex</i> class to create a
    <i>PartitionIndex</i> class. Similarly, this class should implement an 
    interval table, but for partitions (not tetrahedra).

    <h4>Extra question 5</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;
    Modify the <i>Editor</i> class to build your partitions and your partition
    index at the end of <i>Editor::loadInputMesh()</i>. The pre-processing we
    implemented so far in these extra questions is not the best algorithm out
    there, but it's by far the simplest to implement.<br>
    Modify also the <i>IsoSurfacer</i> class to be able to pass it a reference
    to the partition index prior to the isosurface extraction.

    <h4>Extra question 6</h4>
    &nbsp;&middot;
    Implement a function <i>IsoSurfacer::OptimalExtraction()</i> to extract a
    level set. This function should query the partition index to retrieve all
    the partitions that are intersected by the level set.<br>
    By construction, the restriction of the level set to each intersected
    partition should be a single connected component.<br>
    Thus, once valid partition(s) have been found, for each partition, 
    the vertex which has the 
    closest function value with the queried isovalue should be identified in the
    partition (use the function <i>std::set::lower_bound()</i>). 
    We will call this vertex a <i>seed vertex</i>.<br>
    <br>
    Given a <i>seed vertex</i>, among the tetrahedra which contains this
    vertex, there has to be at least one tetrahedron which is intersected by the
    level set (<i>IsoSurfacer::IsCellOnLevelSet()</i>). 
    Let's pick arbitrarily one of these
    and call it a <i>seed tetrahedron</i>.<br>
    Last, for all the <i>seed tetrahedra</i> that have been identified up to
    this point, run the function <i>IsoSurfacer::ExtractContour()</i>.<br><br>

    As a result, this algorithm will ONLY visit the tetrahedra which are indeed
    intersected by the level set, hence yielding an optimal run-time
    complexity for isosurface extraction.<br>
